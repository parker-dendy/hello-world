# hello-world
Says hello to world /s

I'm literally just doing exactly what the github guide is telling me too, even though commits and branches seem intutive and self-explantory. I just wanna make sure I get it so I look like a dope badass hacker when modifying other repositories. Hopefully you'll have fun reading this secondary description. Passes the time, staves off the existential dead, and tells you hello!

Hello.
